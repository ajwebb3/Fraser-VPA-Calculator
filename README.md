# Fraser-VPA-Calculator
An interactive calculator to estimate free VPA concentrations in critically ill adults

# Background
Valproic acid is unique in that it has nonlinear protein binding - while most medications have a consistent percent of total concentration that is protein bound, valproic acid's free concentration increases as the total concentration increases across an unbound percent range of 5-15% in healthy individuals. This relationship is exacerbated in the critically ill, where the unbound percent is significantly increased out of proportion to what is expected from serum albumin.
